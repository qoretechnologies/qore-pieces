title: "Hiring"

Engineers are the majority of the Activepieces team, and we are always looking for highly talented product engineers.

## Responsibilities 

Engineers handle everything from chatting with customers to shipping the code and announcing new features. 

## What we are looking for in Engineering hires

### Technical Skills 

This is the baseline and is required for all levels.

- The engineer should be competent enough to ship autonomously without supervision and should get used to **NOT** asking for approval. They can always discuss with others, but it's not about seeking supervision or approval.

- The engineer should be mindful and always trying to simplify things, such as removing tools from the stack, unifying the code paths, and closing the gap between different editions, making the code easy to maintain.

- Relevant experience in our stack and industry is a great plus.

### Product Skills

- The engineer should be capable of interviewing a customer and converting it into requirements, selecting an appropriate solution, and then shipping it.

- The engineer should communicate directly with the customer on community/Slack channels for feedback and improvements.

- The engineer should be able to discover new opportunities by interacting with the customer or finding gaps in the market.


### Leadership

- The engineer's influence will be beyond themselves. They are a person who can self-reflect and always look for a better way to change anything in the company (Culture/Infrastructure/Strategy). 

- The engineer have a bias for impact and speed. The speed of shipping is one of the reasons why startups thrive, and our community notices it. Speed can be achieved by doing many things, such as removing unnecessary processes, improving the developer experience, deployment, and automated checks.

- The engineer's empathy, empathy with customers, empathy with their colleagues. Empathy allows us to be honest, transparent, and makes it easier to give and receive feedback.

## Compensation

The packages includes two parts: Equity and Base Salary.

We aim for fairness in how we pay our team. We don't raise salaries through negotiation. Instead, pay is based on levels, which depend on how much someone impacts users.

We update salaries based on market trends and how well the business is doing. It's easier to justify raises when the business is thriving.

## How We Conduct Interviews

### Technical Interview

Here, you'll face a real challenge from Activepieces. We'll guide you through it to see how you solve problems.

### Product & Leadership Interview
We'll chat about your past experiences and how you design products. It's like having a friendly conversation where we reflect on what you've done before.

### Work Trial
You'll do paid tasks for a short time. These tasks help us understand how well we work together.

### Interviewing Tips

Every interview should make us say **HELL YES**. If not, we'll kindly pass.

***Avoid Bias***

Get opinions from others to make fair decisions.

***Speak Up Early***

If you're unsure about something, ask or test it right away.
